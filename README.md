# hello-world
first github repository

this is going to be much more fun than emailing myself files on the daily, copying shit to my cheesy flash drive and getting confused on the regular about which version I was using last time since i have 3 ongoing code projects at work that get rotated through depending on what's needed on any given sunday.
